## The challenge

I am doing another frontend challenge to build out a multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
To accomplish this task i will use these tools:
* React JS
* Material-UI
* React router dom
* Loadable components
* React Hook form

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for the Family Gatherings, Special Events, and Social Events section when the user clicks each tab
- Receive an error message when the booking form is submitted if:
  - The `Name` or `Email Address` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
  - Any of the `Pick a date` or `Pick a time` fields are empty should show "This field is incomplete"
